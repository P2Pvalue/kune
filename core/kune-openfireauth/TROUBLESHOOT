* TROUBLESHOOTING

** Manual testing 
You can test if the authentication works via command line using:
java -jar kun-openfirauth.jar <public address:port> <useSsl> <user> <pass>
for instance:
java -jar kune-openfireauth.jar localhost false admin easyeasy

** hostname vs ip address
Seems like with the last kune version, the previous authentication via ip address gives a 404, so as a workaround we have to use the hostname 
** Cannot login when using SSL.
Probably is a issue with the certificate.
